# FinCare (Expense Management System)

In today's fast-paced environment, keeping track of everyday expenditures and frequent charges is a difficult task.
To monitor the ins and outs over time, one can keep note of daily spending on paper or keep an eye out for bank or credit card bills. This not only consumes user time, but it also necessitates a significant amount of effort to calculate and tally up charges. Fincare is the solution for all these problems. Aside from all of the spending analysis features, Fincare also offers interactive visuals such as Bar Charts and Pie Charts to help users better understand their cash flow.
